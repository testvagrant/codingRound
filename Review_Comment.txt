THIS FILE LISTS ALL THE REVIEW COMMENTS/ NEW CHANGES ON THE CURRENT FRAMEWORK
ALSO I HAVE IMPLEMENTED MOST OF THE REVIEW COMMENTS

=> Each test can be executed and is passing right now.
=> The thread.sleep is a hard pause, removed that to introduce dynamic waits.
=> Having selectors local to every test case is code repetition and hard to manage,
hence introduced POM framework.
=> Added surefire plugin to be able to get variables at runtime.
=> Action methods like click, sendKeys have been segregated to a new class "ActionSupport"
=> Added testng.xml file
=> Added BaseTest class to have framework level data initialization globally and
using inheritance to avail it throughout the classes.
=> Updated chromedriver to latest version to support latest chrome version.
=> Introduced property file which is also environment specific to store constants like URL.
