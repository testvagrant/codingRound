Following are the comments for code review:

1. Driver version updated - ChromeDriver version has been updated to stable one.

2. Created a new package test and moved all Tests to it.

3. Created a new package utils and new class SeleniumUtils. To keep setDriverPath, waitFor, isElementPresent, 
loadBrowser, tearDown in a class and can use it in another classes with inheritance.

4. Added testng.xml file to run test cases as a test suite.

Changes in tests:

1. SignInTest : 

a) extended class SeleniumUtils and then called necessary methods.
b) added line 25 for moving focus to iframe "driver.switchTo().frame("modal_window");".

2. FlightBookingTest :

a) extended class SeleniumUtils and then called necessary methods.
b) corrected lines 39 and 40 - "toTag" to "ToTag".

3. HotelBookingTest :

a) extended class SeleniumUtils and then called necessary methods.
